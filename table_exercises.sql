-- 6. Which table do you think contains a numeric type column? Salaries, dept_emp
-- 7. Which table do you think contains a string? I feel like most could have strings besides dept_emp, because I don't know if that contains number(s) or letters.
-- 8. Which table do you think contains a date? Possibly dept_emp, the title is vague so no telling what it means.
-- 9. What is the relationship between the employees and departments tables? Both are in the employees database.

SHOW CREATE TABLE dept_manager;
